# hometab
üè† A hometab page that you can customize to your liking!


# Setup


Right now there is no way to add icons without just modifying the index.html page. Until that functionality is added I won't be adding this to the Chrome web store.
Until that happens you can install the extension as a developer.


## Instructions
1. Go to chrome://extensions/ and check the box for Developer mode in the top right.
2. Click Load Unpacked
3. Select hometab folder
4. Open a new tab and test!
